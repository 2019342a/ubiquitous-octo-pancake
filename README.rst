What is it?
-----------

Personal django cookiecutter to speedup my django projects. Contains a file structure that I like and a bare minimum of libraries that I commonly use.


Usage
-----

Install cookiecutter:

    :code:`$ pip install cookiecutter`

Then run this command:

    :code:`$ cookiecutter https://github.com/2019342a/ubiquitous-octo-pancake`

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

I would definitely recommend building your own cookiecutter project instead of using this one.
It is fun and you have your own custome template. If you require something more advanced and production ready template,
I recommend cookiecutter-django_.
